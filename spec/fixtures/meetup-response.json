Will this event be good for me?</b></p> <p>Totally. No matter if you are a novice or an old pro, there’s something for everyone at SEARCH.</p> <p><b>What is Elasticsearch?</b></p> <p>The world is swimming in data. For years we have been simply overwhelmed by the quantity of data flowing through and produced by our systems. Existing technology has focused on how to store and structure warehouses full of data. That’s all well and good—until you actually need to make decisions in real time informed by that data.</p> <p>Elasticsearch is a real-time distributed search and analytics engine. It allows you to explore your data at a speed and at a scale never before possible. It is used for full-text search, structured search, analytics, and all three in combination:</p> <p>Wikipedia uses Elasticsearch to provide full-text search with highlighted search snippets, and search-as-you-type and did-you-mean suggestions.The Guardian uses Elasticsearch to combine visitor logs with social -network data to provide real-time feedback to its editors about the public’s response to new articles.Stack Overflow combines full-text search with geolocation queries and uses more-like-this to find related questions and answers.Netflix uses it for personalized recommendation and search millions of videos.GitHub uses Elasticsearch to query 130 billion lines of code.</p> <p><b>Can I bring a friend?</b></p> <p>Sure... Everyone is welcome! Just make sure you register for all attendees you plan to bring with you before Tuesday, 02/14/17.</p> <p><b>Will there be food?</b></p> <p>Yes! We will have a yummy selection of pizzas and beverages to help keep your energy and focus on the great technology content and networking opportunity.</p> <p><b>What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?</b></p> <p>Parking is available in the open surface parking lot across from building 450. </p> <p>Take I-40 to exit 270. Turn onto US 15/501(Durham-Chapel Hill Blvd.) headed toward Durham. Follow Durham-Chapel Hill Blvd. past Garrett Road. Stay in right two lanes and bear right to US 15/501 North.

And the people were sad! But our hero Painless came in 5.0, the shining new default, careful, quick, and kind. Ever watchful of its whitelist and loop counters, Painless protects Elasticsearch from malign mandate, inadvertent or iniquitous.</p> <p>Gather and hear of Painless' guiding principles, see the features they represent, and, time permitting, discuss Painless' future.</p> <p><b>Nik Everett</b> is an Elasticsearch Engineer based in North Carolina. Before joining Elastic, Nik worked for the Wikimedia Foundation building on site search for Wikipedia with Elasticsearch.</p> <p><b>Talk#2: Learn how Bitly uses ElasticSearch</b></p> <p>Learn how Bitly uses ElasticSearch to power not just standard search and retrieval of your shortened URLs, but also how we use the aggregations' feature of ElasticSearch to provide up-to-date analytic information on how engaged your target audience is with your content, across the internet at large. We’ll dive into how Bitly uses custom schemas to enable search, and into the details of how Bitly constructs aggregate queries for counting and categorizing. </p> <p><br/><b>Peter Herndon</b> is a Senior Application Engineer at Bitly, where he helps keep links short and smart. Working primarily on back-end systems, he uses an awful lot of open source software and occasionally contributes a bit of working code. Prior to joining Bitly, he worked briefly in the New York startup world, and for a much longer time at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center as a developer and systems administrator. His main passion is designing and building distributed systems, and his main extracurricular hobby is learning and teaching martial arts.</p>",
